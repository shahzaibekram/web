This is a fully functional Event Planner web app, completely build with Python, Flask, PonyORM, and SQLite. You can easily create your events, view/read them and delete them. To do so you have to sign up first and then login to access event management. To build this web app we used two class Organizer and Event. With the help of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, we designed a meaningful and beautiful front-end.
